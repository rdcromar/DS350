## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
gap2 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country != "Kuwait")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data = gap2, mapping = aes(x=year,y=gdpPercap,color=continent,size=pop))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Year",y="GDP per capita")+
  theme_bw()+
  facet_wrap(vars(continent)) 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
