## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
View(flights)
glimpse(flights)
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier))+
  geom_bar()

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_violin()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=flights, mapping = aes(x = carrier, y = arr_delay)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  ggbeeswarm::geom_quasirandom()
```
